Question / Qus :    How does SAP optimize my TCI?
Answer /ans:    SAP has developed different engagement types to support customers to “make their case” and launch their SAP S/4HANA plan, e.g. the SAP S/4HANA Adoption Starter: An expert-guided, self-planning experience in a virtual 1:N format; or the classic Value Discovery: An engagement type for larger customers in an onsite 1:1 format. Independent of these two types, customers can use a number of Value Discovery tools in their own timeframe to build their technical and business cases independently. Furthermore SAP provides many project execution tools that reduce TCI.

Question / Qus :    What are transition paths to S/4HANA?
Answer /ans:    Two main transition paths are available:
- Deploying a new instance of SAP S/4HANA and migrating existing data from an old ERP system. This is the best approach for customers wanting a clean start (in the cloud, on-premise, or hybrid).
- Existing ECC 6.x system to be converted to S/4HANA, migrating the data to HANA as part of that process. Preserves the existing configuration and customization (as long as those customizations will work with S/4HANA or can be adapted to work with S/4HANA).
